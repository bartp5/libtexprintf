New in version 1.25
- support for fixedf size big braces (e.g. `\big[`)
- make dummy commands for `\mathop`, `\mathord` (i.e. ignore without throwing error)
- added `\relstack`

bug fixes
- some memory issues
- allow spaces in things like `\left [`
- fixed some collisions between symbols and keywords. Keywords take presidence over symbols. For example `\\u` is now interpreted as an endline followed by a u and not as `\Ë˜`
